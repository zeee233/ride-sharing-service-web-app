1. A driver cannot re-register after the initial registration. 
Fix: When a driver re-registers, we will update the old data to the new one by using function:Driver.objects.update_or_create

2. The number of sharers should be less than the number of passengers minus the number of the owner. 
Fix: We redo the function. If the car capacity is larger than the rider owner number plus the ride sharer, then it can be searched. Otherwise, it can not be searched 

3. The passenger count should be updated when joining a ride. 
Fix: We separate it into two numbers. One is the total number of people accepted by the ride owner. Another one is the total number in this individual ride. 

4. If the user_id is 0, the user will be set as the driver. 
Fix: We put the initial number for the use_id as NULL 

5. An error will occur when a non-driver tries to query the driver_info. 
Fix: We keep the blank for every detail when the user hasn't registered to be a driver by using a try exception.
